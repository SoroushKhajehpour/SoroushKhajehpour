I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo interested in software, hardware, and the point where the two meet.

Right now I’m building projects in:

• C++ and embedded systems  
• React, JavaScript, and Firebase  
• Firmware concepts through design team work  

Outside of class, I like creating small tools and products to sharpen my skills and learn new tech quickly.
